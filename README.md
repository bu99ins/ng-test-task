# Angular Test Task
The main goal of the task is to show your skills in the best way possible. Please use proper styling, animation and caching.

- UI libraries such as Angular Material are allowed.

## Task
1. Create the new Angular 7 project using angular CLI
2. Create a page with a paginated users list. You should create custom components for the list itself and the particular user card. The user list should be horizontally centered.
3. Use the following HTTP endpoint: https://reqres.in/api/users?page={page} to get the cards data, which includes avatar image, first_name, last_name and id for the card. Single user can be requested via this endpoint: https://reqres.in/api/users/{id}.
4. On click of the card, it should direct to a new page with information about this card.
5. On each individual card page a back button should be present.
6. Introduce caching to avoid additional requests.
